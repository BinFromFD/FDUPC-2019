## Titlecase
### Description
You have found a sentence, which is a line of words consisting of merely uppercase or lowercase English letters, but it turns out to be really odd and incomprehensible because nearly every word in that sentence is a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters, e.g. "sOmeTImES nAiVe". As a result, you want to "titlize" this sentence to render it more readable. We say a sentence is titlecased if and only if all words in the sentence are started with an uppercase letter followed by zero or some lowercase letters. Now it's time to utilize a computer program to help you with this work!

### Input
The input contains only one line of words separated by whitespaces representing the sentence you have just found.

### Output
Output the titlecased version of the sentence given by the input.
